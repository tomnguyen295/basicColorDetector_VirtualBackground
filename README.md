# basicColorDetector_VirtualBackground
Detects color chosen by user in selected image or webcam footage. Can also be used as a virtual background.
- To detect color in images, use colorDetect.py
- To detect color in webcam footage, use colorDetectLive.py
- Sample images are provided


- As of now, the user can only choose red, blue, or green to detect/filter out. Will update variety of choices later
- Thinking of adding a GUI for drop-down files instead of using standard input
- Video feed works but there is a decent amount of noise and overlap between colors sometimes. Could be improved later
